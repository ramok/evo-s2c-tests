$ ./evo-s2c-tests
Scenario test framework for EvoLogics S2C acoustic modems.

 Usage: evo-s2c-tests [flags] [--] <test-names> <IP[:port]>...
 
 -p  - period of sending IMS/%SYNC (default: 'pcsync': 300 sec,'sync': 300 sec,'ims': 3 sec)
 -d  - test duration time (default 600 sec). Possible add suffix 'm' and 'h' for minutes and hours
 -l  - number of tests running in loop
 -y  - answer 'yes' to all questions
 
 -h  - this help
 -v  - verbose log
 
 IP[:port]    - Modem IP and optional port. Can be in short NUM in 192.168.0.<NUM>
 test-names   - Can be 'all' or comma separated test names.
                Available tests: pcsync sync ims
 
 
Test 'pcsync' descrition:
 Sync physical clock of main modem with PC clock and on remote modems.
 Checking periodically physical clock syncing with PC in main modem

Test 'sync' descrition:
 Send AT%SYNC (point to point) periodically. Log the correction
 returned by AT%SYNC command.

Test 'ims' descrition:
 Send IMS every Y seconds during X hours to collect data
 about mutual clock drift between a transmitter and receivers

Usage examples:
 
 # Run all test with modems 192.168.0.171:9200 and 192.168.0.162:9200 
 # Modem 192.168.0.171:9200 will act as main modem.
 $ ./evo-s2c-tests all 171 162
 
 # Run all test with modems 192.168.0.171:9200 and 192.168.0.162:9200 
 # Tests will be repeat 1 time for each modem as master, 2 times in total.
 $ ./evo-s2c-tests -l 1 all 171 162
 
 # Run tests 'ims' and 'sync' with modems 192.168.0.171:9200 and 192.168.0.162:9200 
 # Tests will be repeat 2 time for each modem as master, 4 times in total.
 # All interactive menu will be skipped.
 $ ./evo-s2c-tests -y -l 2 ims,sync 171 162
